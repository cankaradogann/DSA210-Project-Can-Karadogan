    "## Building three core AVWAPs anchored to three important 1-minute candles\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the project, we build **three special AVWAP lines** on our SPY 1-minute data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand them, we first need to understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)**\n",
    "- **AVWAP (Anchored VWAP)**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is VWAP?\n",
    "\n",
    "**VWAP** is like an **average price**, but with a twist:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Minutes with **more volume** get **more weight**.\n",
    "- Minutes with **less volume** get **less weight**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So VWAP tells us:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “At what price did most of the trading actually happen?”\n",
    "\n",
    "How traders often think about it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the **current price is far above VWAP**  \n",
    "  → price may be **stretched up** (expensive vs. where most trading was).\n",
    "- If the **current price is far below VWAP**  \n",
    "  → price may be **stretched down** (cheap vs. where most trading was).\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, VWAP acts like a **fair value line** for a chosen period.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Anchored VWAP (AVWAP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anchored VWAP (AVWAP)** is just a VWAP with a **fixed starting point**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We pick a **specific time** (the **anchor**).\n",
    "- From that time onward, we compute VWAP using:\n",
    "  - All bars from **the anchor time** up to **the current minute**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A normal VWAP might restart each day.\n",
    "- An **AVWAP** starts at a **chosen event** and keeps going forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we anchor it?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The anchor tells us **exactly** which part of price history is being summarized.\n",
    "- Example anchors:\n",
    "  - The **open** of the day\n",
    "  - A **news event**\n",
    "  - A **strong move** (like a fast rally or selloff)\n",
    "\n",
    "So an AVWAP answers:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “What is the volume-weighted average price **since this specific moment**?”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our three AVWAP anchors in this project\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we use **three important starting points (anchors)** to build three AVWAP lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Strongest 5-minute up move**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - We look at all 5-minute windows in the day.\n",
    "   - We find the 5-minute period where:\n",
    "     - Price went **up the most** (largest positive change).\n",
    "   - This 5-minute block marks a strong **upward burst of buying**.\n",
    "   - From the **start** of this 5-minute block, we anchor an AVWAP:\n",
    "     - This AVWAP tracks the **average cost of buyers** who joined during and after this strong up move.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Strongest 5-minute down move**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - We again scan all 5-minute windows.\n",
    "   - This time, we find the 5-minute period where:\n",
    "     - Price went **down the most** (largest negative change).\n",
    "   - This block marks a strong **downward burst of selling**.\n",
    "   - From the **start** of this 5-minute block, we anchor another AVWAP:\n",
    "     - This AVWAP tracks the **average cost of sellers** who pushed the price down.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Exact market open at 09:30:00**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - We also anchor an AVWAP at the **official session open**:\n",
    "     - **09:30:00 U.S. Eastern Time**\n",
    "   - This AVWAP represents the **average price since the very start of the day**.\n",
    "   - It captures the **overall position** of those who traded from the open onward.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why these three AVWAPs matter\n",
    "\n",
    "With these three anchored VWAPs, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One AVWAP for **the strongest up move** (bullish burst anchor)\n",
    "- One AVWAP for **the strongest down move** (bearish burst anchor)\n",
    "- One AVWAP for **the whole day starting at the open**\n"

    "  → the volume-weighted average price is moving **higher** (benchmark getting more expensive).\n",

    "  → the volume-weighted average price is moving **lower** (benchmark getting cheaper).\n",
    "- If the slope is **near zero** → the AVWAP is **flat**  \n",

    "  - Upward pressure vs. downward pressure\n",
    "  - Trend-like vs. balanced conditions\n",
